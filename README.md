Note: Inspired by her Repo and co-authored papers on ArXive recently reviewed by myself,

These ideas highlight DGM's potential to bootstrap AGI but raise challenges: computational costs, safety in recursive self-modification, and ethical alignment. Future work should prioritize sandboxed evolution and human-AI collaboration. Impacts include accelerated innovation in robotics, education, and science, but risks like uncontrolled emergence must be mitigated. Or at least moderated, IMO.
This paper outlines 100 pathways to evolve DGM into autonomous AGI systems, bridging theory and practice. By fostering experiential self-learning, we move closer to intelligent machines that evolve indefinitely.
